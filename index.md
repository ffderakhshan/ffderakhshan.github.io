My name is Fariba Derakhshan and Iâ€™m currently teaching at Cal Poly Pomona.

I enjoy meeting new people and finding ways to help them have an uplifting experience.

I am a dedicated person and  enjoy reading. and the knowledge and perspective that my reading gives me has strengthened my teaching skills and presentation abilities. I  ability to plan, schedule, and handle many different tasks at once. This flexibility will help me in the classroom, where there are many different personalities and learning styles.
